# Darkly Vulnerability Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups and solutions for the vulnerabilities discovered while working on the Darkly project. Darkly is an introductory project in web security that exposes common vulnerabilities in web applications, providing a hands-on learning experience in identifying and exploiting real-world issues.

## Overview

The Darkly project challenges you to:
- Discover various web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, etc.)
- Understand how these vulnerabilities are exploited
- Learn the methodology behind successful penetration testing and remediation

In this repository, you’ll find a collection of folders, each dedicated to a specific vulnerability challenge along with a detailed writeup explaining my approach and solution.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── README.md
├── Vulnerability1/
│   ├── flag
│   ├── Resources
│   └── writeup.md
├── Vulnerability2/
│   ├── flag
│   ├── Resources
│   └── writeup.md
└── ...
```

- **writeup.md:** A detailed explanation of the vulnerability, the exploit process, and the remediation steps.
- **flag:** A file containing the result of the challenge (or flag) demonstrating successful exploitation.
- **Resources:** Supporting files or scripts used in the solution (no binaries included).

## Project Background

The Darkly project was designed to introduce beginners to cybersecurity in the web environment. It walks you through:
- **Identifying vulnerabilities:** Understanding how and why certain web applications are vulnerable.
- **Exploitation techniques:** Learning practical methods for exploiting these vulnerabilities.
- **Security best practices:** Gaining insight into how to secure web applications against similar attacks.

This repository is a record of my journey through the challenges, capturing both the learning process and the technical details of each solution.
